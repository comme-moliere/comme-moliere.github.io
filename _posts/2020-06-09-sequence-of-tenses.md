# Sequence of tenses

In French, the sequence of tenses enforces us to have relevant tenses through
one single sentence or even through one single paragraph / idea.

One common difficulty French learners struggle with is the `si + pronoun + verb`.
(Honestly some Frenches struggle with it too).

## First case : imperfect and present conditional

Here is an example:

`Si je savais programmer, je gagnerais plus d’argent.`

*If I knew how to program, I would earn more money.*

The struggle here is not towards understanding, but towards *producing a correct sentence*.

Here you have two verbs: [savoir](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/savoir.php)
(which is conjugated to the **imperfect**) and [gagner](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/gagner.php)
(which is conjugated to the **present conditional**).

This is the most common form of conditional speaking with `si + pronoun + verb`.
**Here, if the first verb is conjugated with the imperfect, the second verb absolutely must be conjugated with the present conditional. Always.**

These are correct :

`Si j’étais à Paris, j’irais voir mon cousin.`

*If I was in Paris, I would pay a visit to my cousin.*

`Si j’étais végétarien, je ne mangerais plus de viande.`

*If I was vegetarian, I would not eat any more meat.*

That one are not correct (sometimes native speakers make this mistake, beware!):

`Si j’aurais un ordinateur, je jouerais au Sims.`

*If I had a computer, I would play to the Sims.*

Here, the verb [savoir](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/savoir.php) is conjugated to the present conditional, or this is **wrong**. It should have
been conjugated with the imperfect, like this:

`Si j’avais un ordinateur, je jouerais au Sims.`

*If I had a computer, I would play to the Sims.*

Last but not least: this combination express a *possibility in the past*. The person who uses these tenses says he would like the situation to happen, but it would never happen (probably not).

If you want to talk about a situation that is likely to happen in the future, you must use present + simple future, like follow:

## Second case: present of the indicative + future of the indicative

This case deals with conditional situations that are likely to happen (in the future). Example :

`Si j’ai un enfant, il s’appelera Charles.`

*If I have a kid, he will be named Charles.`

So here we have the verb [avoir](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/avoir.php), which is conjugated to the present of the indicative, and the
verb [s’appeler](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/s_appeler.php) which is conjugated to the future of the indicative.


**Rule of thumb: always use the future tense after the present tense if you use this form of conditional speaking.**

There is a last — but not least – form that you can use for things that, like, "just happened" and that you want to express kind of a regret of not having done something: using pluperfect and conditional first pass.

## Third case : pluperfect and conditional first past

This case deals with situations where you want to express the regret of something not to have happened. Example:

`Si j’avais su que tu étais sur Paris, je serais venu te voir.`

*If I had know that you were in Paris, I would have paid you a visit.*

Here we are conjugating the verb [savoir](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/savoir.php) at the pluperfect, then the verb [venir](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/venir.php) at the conditional first pass.

The speaker is clearly indicating that he/she regrets not having known the piece of information earlier (the fact that his/her friend was in Paris) at some point in the past, and what would happen if he/she only had known.

## In a nutshell

Upon conditional cases like the ones we have covered above, the sequence of tenses states that:

  * if you use **imperfect**, then you must use **conditional present** (for something that would not likely happen);
  * if you use **present of the indicative, then you must use **future of the indicative** (for something that would likely happen, in the future);
  * if you use **pluperfect** then you must use **the conditional first past** (for something that happened at some point that you wish it happened differently).

Wish you all the best through learning French. *Bon courage !*
