# Verbs and prepositions

Hey French learners! Today, a quick not on how to use preposition after certain
intransitive verbs.

First as a reminder: what is an intransitive verb? Well, it's a verb that has
no object.

So you might wonder (because you might have forgotten your grammar courses):
what is a transitive verb? Simply a verb that has an object. Example with
the 1st group verb [manger](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/manger.php)
(*to eat*):

`Je mange du poisson`.

*I eat some fish*.

The (grammatical object) is the fish, as the fish is being eaten. Putting simply,
the action is directly made on the object.

Now, here is an example of intransitive verb: [voler](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/voler.php)
(*to fly*, but can mean *to steal*, which is transitive):

`Je vole dans le ciel`.

*I fly in the sky.*

You obviously can fly in the sky if you are in a plane or if you have wings.
But **you cannot fly the sky**. You do not fly anything. It is a non sense, for sure.

Well, in French, there are intransitive verbs which, once combined with other verbs, needs to
have a preposition in between to be correct French.

For instance, many foreigners want to translate this sentence into French:

*I continue to speak*.

Here, you can see that there is a preposition (*to*) between continue and speak.

Some foreigners who are not aware of preposition and comes from foreign languages,
like Turkish or Japanese, may say this:

`Je continue parler` (which is wrong).

Here we use both verbs [continuer](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/continuer.php) (to continue)
and [parler](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/parler.php) (to speak) from the 1st group.

The verb `continuer` needs to be followed by the preposition `à` when you mean that you continue to do something /
you keep doing something.

Examples :

`Je continue à parler.` (O.K.)

*I continue to speak.*

Or:

`Tu continues à manger du pain.`

*You keep eating bread.*

Etc.

Now that you have understood this simple rule, here is a list of verbs followed by the prepositions that you should
use:

  - [arrêter](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/arreter.php) (*to stop*) : `arrêter de` + infinitive verb.
  - [décider](https://la-conjugaison.nouvelobs.com/du/verbe/decider.php) (*to decide*) : `décider de` + infinitive verb.

Examples:

`J’arrête de manger de la viande.`

*I stop eating meat.*

`Je décide d’apprendre le français.`

*I decide to learn French.*

That's it, for the moment! The above list could be expanded if I meet foreigners making mistakes with some other verbs.
Please note that you will mostly be understood by native speakers whether you do mistakes or not, so this is not a big
point regarding your goals. But if you want to speak proper French, then this note might be a relevant option! ;)

*Bon courage !*
